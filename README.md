<b>ADRAC RACOL Cont.</b>
<body background= white>
<p>As u have been shown in the last website, You've been made to understand who I am and those things I lyk,<br>Now u would be told au much i have gone about my personal life</p>
<p>Thanks for ur loving interest, Love uuuuuuuu</p>
<h2 align= "center">GIST GO GO</h2>
<p>This is the part that I like the most, talking about <b><i>MY KOREAN STAR FAVOURITE</i></b>, ofcourse noting can be compared to writing about what u like most, well i am doing this in secret bcos My dad must nt know wat my design is all bt, so if u knw bt this u mustnt tell my dad, <b>ARASO?</b></p>
<p>The first person I will talk bt is <b><i>Shin Hye-sun,</i></b> well this is bcos it is her first Protagonist movie I am watching, recently made in the Year 2017, and to be February Ending, 2018. This girl is so cool that she took up all her actions seriously, honestly dere a times when i will wish that I was in her shoes, I am sure I would have worked harder, even as a small girl, but one tin i dnt like is the main actor, he would look handsome and cool in some places and then later look like this man in his early 40s, im tired of seeing him not handsome but he acts in a cul way which made me to like him <b>"In Partial"</b></p>
<p>Am gusing one thing which i dnt pray its true bt this film, how can my poor and cute <b><em>Seo Ji-soo</em></b> become the antagonist. <b>"N.B. This is just my thinking"</b>. We were the film right now she is acting up just like a similar Korean antagonist and the funniest tin she was once like an immature kid but I wonder au come she can only tink of herself in this situtaion and how can she slap her former twin sister, thou I may not hate her but still it makes me sad to see her dat way.</p>

<p><b>MISSING 9</b></p>
<p>Honestly, I didn't finish this film all becos I was sleeping when d film was being watched. On this film I have complains and I will like my follwers to pls give me their touts, au can <em><b>MY GOLDEN LIFE</b></em> have a higher rating of over 20 in just 4 episodes wilde dis so cul movie have the highest of 7.0 and do u kw wats more fustrating, the episode I expected for it to have one of the highest rating had just a normal rating, wat is more fustrating compared to this, and another tin, episode 1 carried one of the highest rating and then the third and second episodes to the end has lowest rating, <em><b>I wonder how Korean rate tins, Pls are u sure those people are mentally alright, or is it because of the great romance that is lacking, this is making me go crazy honestly an highly disappointed and fustrated and exhausted of thinking!!</b></em></p>

<p>In this same film there is a boy whoz death is the most painful to me, he is cute, has a face of a baby generaly lets say that au his face is for real I will like him to be mai BF <b><i>Fangirling</i></b> but seriously, he is too handsome and cute, His real name is Park Chan-yeol and his name in the movie is Lee Yeol he is a 25 year old boy debuted in 2012 as a member of the group <b>EXO</b>, Sori guyz but after reading bt him I fell jealous, Really sori bt dat. "Smile"</p>
<p>Do u tink dat u will lyk the main actor, well 4 me I realy lyk him.</p>

<p>I am watching another movie Temperature of Love, OMG this film is so romantic and funny, I like the main actress especially her act up, I like it when girls play hard to get and that makes it one of the reason why I hate Pinnochio Syndrome, thou their chemistry seems cul and okay and even i still tink of it, Park Shin Hye had no chance to play hard to get because she cant lie, disgusting <b>This is a bad advice but I tink it is good for girls to lie, N.B. only whenit comes to playing hard to get o</b></p>
<p>This news is so fustrating who cares bt it, well maybe i so, </p>

<p>This Movie <b><em>Temperature of Love</em></b> is realy funny, lyk u should watch i cant really tell au many times ave been laughing, there is a good chemistry between the main actor and actress, I woul dgive u updates later because i have not done any reasearch, Im still watching it, i lyk the film dats all it very interesting</p>
<p>Honestly, if we are talking of chemistry i still lyk this films chemistry it will name it <b><em>Super Romantic Chemistry</em></b> My Chemistry Teacher I am so sori 4 adding those but the chemical equation for this two is more than ballance, it is perfect, SO ROMANTIC</p>

<p><img src= "TOL.jpg"></p>
<p>I'm Still a teen but not to lie am super jealous of this two, Honestly Just Lisen to the conversation:</p>
<p>Boy: Wat<br>Girl: I want to kiss you, you can dodge it if u dont want to<br>I tout he wouldnt doge it but as deir lips were about to touch the boy just dodge it and d girl was laughing and she said<br>Girl: Wai do u do dat<br>Boy: To make u laugh or maybe cry(Smile)<br>Girl: But am fustrated<br>Boy: Okay M'sori, Lets kiss now<br>Girl: Den I wont let u do it alone<br>Boy: Okay, U chose (From here i was like blushing sori bt dat)The tennage's version, 20's version or the 30's version<br>Girl: I will take all and add a refrigirator kiss on top<br>And after dat the show began</p>
<p>Were I watched it to it has not finished but with d look of tins i wish deir relationship will not break (Amen)</p>
<p><em><b>I will be back</b></em></p>
<p>I was surprised wen I watched Shoping King Louis and I saw Louis, and others dabing, I dnt know koreans do dat, i was alitle bit surprised</p>
<p><b>Before the Temperature of love kiss I told u, this was their first kiss:</b></p>
<p>I want to kiss you, do i need to take responsibility 4 dat, No, I dnt knw if this is love or not, I cant really tel what this is, You won't be able to get a woman's kiss by being so honest lyk dat, women tend to fantasize that guys kiss them be cause they are in love, U can avoid it if u dnt want to kiss me. Then after a look, u kissed her, when u saw that she did nt doge it, u kissed her real and passionate</p>
<p><img src= "FIRST.jpg"></p>
<p>Honestly when watching lyk just look at that passionate face, it alone is crushing me hard</p>
<p><img src= "SECOND.jpg"></p>
<p>Seriously Im in need of a a real website and im going to make it im going to write a story named <b><em>"STEPS OF LOVE"</em></b> with the short of ADRACOL<sup>tm</sup>
